      <h2>About Spirited-Globe</h2>
      <p>
        We believe every student deserves easy access to mental health support. College life brings pressure, uncertainty, and challenges that can feel heavyâ€”but help should never be out of reach. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building a digital-first solution that is private, stigma-free, and tailored for Indian students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our platform combines smart tools, professional guidance, and peer support to make mental well-being simple and accessible. With technology and empathy at the core, our mission is to help students stay strong, connected, and readyÂ forÂ theÂ future.
